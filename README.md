# CS370_Artificial-Intelligence

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given the mostly complete code for an AI model that trains to move through and complete a simple maze. My job was to implement deep Q-learning to train the model until it achieves a 100% win rate. The code that I wrote is labelled as such.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Our world is practically run by computers, and their role in our daily lives is only becoming greater, so computer scientists do very important work. They create the devices people use on a daily basis, maintain the internet and everything contained on it, and are even involved in maintaining national security with the aid of technology.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

To consider a problem as a computer scientist is to approach it from several perspectives. A good computer scientist can come up with innovative solutions to challenges while also keeping in mind the ethical, financial, ecological, and physical implications of their solutions. They understand that there is no single answer to any problem and seek new solutions where others have been inadequate. As I am entering the field of computer science, I must remember how important my work is, the impact it could have, and that I may need to try several approaches before the best one can be found.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, I have certain ethical responsibilities to uphold. I must always strive to be ethical in my work, never creating anything that in any way infringes on a person's rights, purposefully deceives, or perpetuates illegal activity. It is my duty to refuse when asked to do something I deem unethical and to always act in the best interest of the end user. Computer scientists should all work towards a better future, and I think it is very important never to lose sight of this. We have more power than we may think, and we must do our best to use this power for good.
